# **jsdataframe**

**Jsdataframe** is a JavaScript data wrangling library inspired by
data frame functionality in R and Python Pandas.  Vector and data frame
constructs are implemented to provide vectorized operations, summarization
methods, subset selection/modification, sorting, grouped
split-apply-combine operations, database-style joins, reshaping/pivoting,
JSON serialization, and more.
It is hoped that users of R and Python Pandas will find the concepts
in jsdataframe quite familiar.

Jsdataframe works in both Node.js and the browser and has no dependencies.

For documentation [see the wiki](https://github.com/osdat/jsdataframe/wiki).
